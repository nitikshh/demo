Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the modified code with a dark mode design using CSS:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #1f1f1f;
      color: #ffffff;
    }
    
    h1 {
      color: #ffffff;
    }
    
    p {
      color: #d3d3d3;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
  <p>This is the content of my website in dark mode.</p>
</body>
</html>
I hope this updated code meets your expectations! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.
